# Quick Introduction of this project background
Eniac (a fictional company) is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. Founded around ten years ago in Spain, the company has since expanded into neighboring countries.
In addition to offering a wide and competitively priced product catalog, Eniac provides customers with professional and friendly technical support and consultation.

Since going public, investors have been pushing Eniac to scale its operations and become a global e-commerce leader.
However, expanding the business while preserving Eniac’s signature human touch presents a significant challenge.
This warm, customer-focused service spirit—rooted in direct interaction—is a core value of the company.

As a Data Analyst, my role within the team goes beyond data processing. It also involves cross-departmental communication and ensuring that my work is aligned with Eniac’s overall strategic goals.
